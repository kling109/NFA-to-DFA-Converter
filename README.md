# NFA to DFA Converter

Assignment 1

## Introduction

This program seeks to provide a framework to convert non-deterministic finite state autonomata to equivalent deterministic finite-state autonomata.  The program takes an input text file which specifies the 5-tuple defining the NFA, and then produces an output text file which then corresponds to a new, expanded DFA 5-tuple.

## Specification
The program is written in C++, using only default libraries.  Compile and run on the Linux command line with g++.  Requires C++ 11 or higher.  File name inputs are taken from the command line.

## Known Issues
None.
